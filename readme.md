# Tbbr
Tbbr is a Chrome extension I made for sane tab management. Best used in conjunction with [Vimium C](https://github.com/gdh1995/vimium-c)

I hacked this together and don't recommend you using this.


## Installation

First download files
```sh
npx degit doeixd/Tbbr ~/.local/share
```

Then go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions), and turn on developer mode

After that, click *Load unpacked* and navigate/select `~/local/share/Tbbr`

Finally, navigate to [chrome://extensions/shortcuts](chrome://extensions/shortcuts) and create a keyboard shortcuts for the tab selection mode


## Usage

Tbbr only does two things.

First, Tbbr will automatically order your tabs accordingly to when they were last active. Allowing you to easily keep track of your tabs.

Second, Tbbr adds a tab selection mode that allows you to switch to any open tab with only 2 keystrokes. To use this, first activate the mode with
the keyboard shortcut defined above. Then press the letter corresponding to the tab you wish to navigate to, as shown on the tab's title.
